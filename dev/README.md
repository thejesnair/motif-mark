# Development 

This folder contains planning, testing scripts, intermediate output pngs during motif-mark.py development.

`list_of_classes.txt` and `interactions.txt` describe planned classes as well as their interactions for OOP script writing.

`pycairo_basics.py` tests out basics for image rendering: draws a line and a rectangle.

`testing.py` is a sandbox script used as scratchwork to test and debug functions or classes as standalone before incorporating into main OOP script. It is also used to write pseudocode as `motif-mark.py` was developed.

`/testing_pngs` contains intermediate png files from testing motif rendering functions and from `pycairo_basics.py`.

`testing.fasta` contains a single FASTA record to test reading multiline FASTA input as a single sequence.
